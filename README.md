# Website-Frontend

This serves as the frontend repository for my website [leanjunio.com](https://leanjunio.com).

## Motivation

The reason I divided my backend and my frontend is to allow the frontend and the backend to be completely separated in file structure. It's just a matter of preference for me.

## Tech / Framework used

- React
- Webpack
- Babel
- Bulma
- Axios
- React Router

## Current Features

## Description

This frontend web application is made using React and Webpack as my chosen module bundler. I chose to use webpack because of its configurability. On the frontend framework area, I decided to use React. React I find is much easier to maintain and is much more flexible than something like Angular for what I am trying to do. It is very easy to pass state from one component to another using children props and it's also very straightforward for my use case.

Another reason I also like React is that it lends itself as a great frontend library and not a framework. For my purposes, I wanted to try as much as possible to keep my application light.
